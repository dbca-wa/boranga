-- Fauna OCC Points All  (KB Report)
-- DevOps Task #15564
-- Frequency: Monthly
--
-- One row per OccurrenceGeometry (Point type) for Fauna Occurrences.
-- Returns ALL processing statuses.
--
-- NOTE: OCC_MOD_BY is resolved via accounts_emailuser and returns
-- first_name || ' ' || last_name for the last user to modify the record.
--
-- NOTE: OBS_DATE is sourced from boranga_occanimalobservation (animal_obs.obs_date).
--
-- NOTE: primary_detection_method, secondary_sign, and reproductive_state are
-- MultiSelectFields that store comma-separated IDs. They are resolved to
-- display names via lateral unnest joins to their respective lookup tables.
--
-- IMPORTANT — KB does not allow comments in SQL queries. Before pasting this
-- script into KB, strip all comments using:

-- Or write the result to a file for easy copying:
