    Wrap an existing upload_to (callable or string) and return a new callable suitable

    - upload_to: callable(instance, filename) -> path OR a string directory
    - name_generator: callable(instance=None, filename=None) -> str, defaults to uuid4 hex

    Usage examples
    - file = models.FileField(upload_to=randomize_upload_to(old_upload_to_fn))
